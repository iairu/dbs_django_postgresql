    <h1>Hello <strike>FIIT</strike> World!</h1>
    <h2>Content (Static Demo)</h2>
    <p>
        Because I don't see a reason to pay for a dedicated Postgres instance, these are static snapshot taken
        right after the final project submission. Other than the load times (which are faster for static files,
        because no SQL query now takes place during load) and .json appendix, the following content reflects
        results from my SQL queries from the Django project which can be found on my GitHub. Project was originally
        hosted on DigitalOcean.com with free $100 of student credit of which $84 was still left by the end of the
        semester (cheap stuff, easy administration, highly recommend!). Current static version is hosted using free
        Vercel tier, unless something changed in the distant future. ~iairu
